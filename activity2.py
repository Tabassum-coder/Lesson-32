#Create a python program to create a flashcard using object-oriented programming.
#  A flashcard is a two-sided card with information on both sides that can assist memory. A question and an answer are usually printed on one side of a flashcard. Follow these steps to complete the activity - 
# 1. From the user, take the input for a word and its definition. 
# 2. To assign values for Word and Meaning, 
# create a class called flashcard and use the __init__() function.
#  3. We'll use the __str__() function to get a string with the term and its definition.
#  4. Save the strings that have been returned in a list.
#  5. To print all of the stored flashcards, use a while loop.


class flashcard:
	def __init__(self, word, meaning):
		self.word = word
		self.meaning = meaning
	def __str__(self):
		
		#we will return a string
		return self.word+' ( '+self.meaning+' )'
		
flash = []
print("welcome to flashcard application")

#the following loop will be repeated until
#user stops to add the flashcards
while(True):
	word = input("enter the name you want to add to flashcard : ")
	meaning = input("enter the meaning of the word : ")
	
	flash.append(flashcard(word, meaning))
	option = int(input("enter 0 , if you want to add another flashcard otherwise enter 1 : "))
	
	if(option):
		break
		
# printing all the flashcards
print("\nYour flashcards")
for i in flash:
	print(">", i)
