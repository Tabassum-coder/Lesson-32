#Write a program to create a quiz related to multiple fruits using object-oriented programming in Python. Create a class that consists of -
#  1. a constructor with a dictionary of fruits and respective colours
#  2. a function to execute the quiz. Here, the fruit will be chosen at random from the dictionary. 
# Then ask the user to enter the colour of that fruit.
#  Evaluate the answer and display the result accordingly.
